        iv. Generic pass startup/cleanup
    b. Planning and Scheduling
        i. Scheduling
        ii. Homegrown HTML tools, made by MMOC and scheduling team.  Based DSN pass scheduling, puts time into CRON which calls ITOS STOL procedure
        iii. One instance of HTML tools handles both missions

        v. CRON-based
        vi. ITOS procs missions specific, some common processes, setup/teardown, runs over list - make shift array that holds processes that should be shutdown
            1. Pass cleanup, pid update, tlm destroy, user input, temp wait
            2. Tools for way getting at particular piece, simpler than whats available from ITOS

        ii. Virtualization
            1. No virtualization
            2. Just more work, more configuration
            3. Transition always a challenge and a risk
            4. Shared resources could get squeezed by higher priority missions
                - Other side is that more capability could be available that would not otherwise be available
                - Resource contention
        iii. Hardware
            1. PC windows for CMS, GMAN and ITPS

            3. Payload
                - PI sends in text files for requests- WIND
                - Regular process, more automated
                - ACE is all done real time, requests come in via email
                - Infrequent

        v. Limit violation, trending
        vi. Biggest issue knowledge about spacecraft and how it works
            1. Depth and breadth
            2. Much docuementation
            3. How is spacecraft, and ground software system

    c. Freemind - Flash hosted
    d. Any other automation would like to have?
        i. Happy with CRON
        ii. When you identify something repeating enough than would automate
        iii. Restarting ITOS
            1. Easier to fix the existing verison of ITOS than
            2. Cost/risk of regression
            3. Prograting changes
            4. Risk of new enhancements breaking custom
    e. What do we need? spacecrafts work in a specfic way.  Things change, want simple flexible tools. Have suite of tools that are updatable.
        i. Build around a core of tools MathLab that should do in basic stuff and do it right without bugs
        ii. GUIs are not automatable
        iii. Nice to have access to CLI
        iv. Prefer access to underlying functions
        v. Rather not have bring up to main process and GUI to access a single function
6. COF Advantages & Disadvantages
    a. Why do think we are not using multi mission facilities now?
        i. Every new mission has funding to their own
        ii. Mission manager wants to their way, have the money so will spend it as sees fit
    b. Short term mission with no money would be interested in shared resources
        i. Cubesat mission
    c. Orbital, UC Berkley, Penn State very competitive cost wise
        i. Disadvantage is they are in their in silo, don't have access to resources like expertise at Goddard
    d. Already share the conference room
    e. Share facility
        i. Depends on number of missions
        ii. Not issue sharing with 3 missions, depends on space available
    f. Baseline core procs? common software?
        i. Hardware being different
        ii. Hard to adjust to new tool when used to old tool
        iii. Two SSRs would respond in similar way
        iv. Could organize documenation in same way
    g. TPOC - resuable software 75%, why did everyone have there own TPOC? MSOC as multi mission was not embraced and not sustainable.
