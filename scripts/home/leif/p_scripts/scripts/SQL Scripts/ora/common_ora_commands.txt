Using Oracle

Want to know all tables in the dB?
SELECT table_name FROM sys.all_tables;
or
SELECT owner, table_name FROM sys.all_tables;
+-------------------------------------------------------+
* Use DBCA to create database from scratch
+-------------------------------------------------------+
* To view running ORA services:
run lsnrctl from command line to view ora services

Check Connection:
- use tnsping
// eg. tnsping xe 4
+-------------------------------------------------------+
* Drop all schema objects for a user.
It's easiest to just drop/add the user.  Make sure no open SQL developer 
apps coonected as svc.  Connect as SYSTEM : ora220 Then run:

drop user svc cascade;
purge recyclebin;
select * from user_objects

Use web interface to create a svc user with all privileges
Reconnect with SQL Developer to SID "xe" svc/svc and confirm
all db objects gone
sql plus connect as sysdba, login as sys / ora220
create user lge identified by lge;
grant connect to lge;
grant create any table to lge;
grant create table to lge;select
grant unlimited tablespace to lge;

(from cmd line run "@c:\sql\create_svc.sql") or do the following
create user svc identified by svc;
grant connect to svc;
grant create any table to svc;
grant create table to svc;
grant unlimited tablespace to svc;
grant create sequence to svc;
grant create trigger to svc;
grant create procedure to svc;
grant create materialized view to svc;
grant create view to svc;
ALTER USER svc quota unlimited on USERS;
