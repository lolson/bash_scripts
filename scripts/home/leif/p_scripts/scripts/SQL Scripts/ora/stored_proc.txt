Stored Procedure - Discover Devices

BTW why bother with mesh gates? This should be entirely transparent to Unity.
createDeviceInfos(); 

Insert devices into tbldevice_info all devices present in device_pkey table and not present in tbldevice_info.
Assign partner_id and product_id to every meshgates

configureMeshgates(partner);
Merge into tbldevice_info tdi
USING
(SELECT device_id, p.model
   FROM product p, device_view dv
  WHERE p.model = dv.model
    AND p.model = 'ND05' 
) u
on u.device_id = tdi.device_id
WHEN MATCHED
 UPDATE
    SET partner_id = parm_Partner_id
         product_id = u.product_id
)
Assign partner_id and product_id to every devices

configureDevices();

UPDATE tbldevice_info
   SET partner_id = parm_default_Partner
;

MERGE INTO tbldevice_info di
USING
(SELECT product_id, DEVICEID
   FROM tblproduct p, device_view dv, tbllookup t, tbllookup t1
  WHERE t.lookup_id = p.device_type_id 
    and t.value = dv.DEVICECLASS 
    and t.value IS NOT NULL
    AND dv.mesh_radio_version like '_% %'
    and t1.lookup_id = p.radio_type_id 
    AND    t1.value     = dv.mesh_radio_version
) u
on (u.DEVICEID = di.DEVICE_ID)
WHEN matched THEN
UPDATE

 configureDevices(); include configureMeshgates(partner);
