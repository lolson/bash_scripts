INSTALLATION STEPS
------------------

1. Stop Unity 
	Verify no active java process for Unity
2. Stop Task Manager
	Verify no active java process for Task Manager

3. Stop the Configuration Manager
	Verify no active java process for the Configuration Manager
	
4. Revert 9.4 GA specific upgrades to the database

5. Upgrade Configuration Manager

	1.	Create a backup of <configuration_manager_home> directory
	2. 	Ensure you take a back up of the derby folder : <configuration_manager_home>/Tomcat/bin/derby
	3.      Delete the contents in the <configuration_manager_home>/Tomcat/work and <configuration_manager_home>/Tomcat/temp folders.
	4.	Install the old configurationManager: bash <configurationmanager_installer_executable> -f <properties_file> -i console
		You could use the same properties file used during installation of the previous version.
	5.	Once installation process is completed, delete directory <configurationmanager_home>/Tomcat/bin/derby  
	6.	Restore derby from your backup directory : Move <configurationmanager_home_backup>/Tomcat/bin/derby  to <configurationmanager_home>/Tomcat/bin/derby  

6. Start Configuration Manager

	Start configuration manager process (Tomcat) :  sudo bash <configuration_manager_home>/Tomcat/bin/startup.sh
	1.	Log in configuration manager add go to the following URL: http://<configuration_manager_server>:<configuration_manager_port>/svccnfg	
	2. 	Ensure that all your process containers are populated correctly
	
7. Upgrade Task Manager

	1.	Run: sudo chmod +x <installer_excutable_file>
	2.	Start the installation process:  sudo bash <installer_executable> -f <properties_file> -i console
		You can use properties file of the previous release. Be sure that the licence file (the path is set in the properties file) is still available.
	3.	Once completed, user can examine the installation log file to ensure that the installation process completed without error.
	4.	Execute : sudo chmod -R +x <SVC_HOME>/bin/*
	5.	Upgrade database: sudo bash <SVC_HOME>/bin/upgradeDB.sh (this is create the procedures that did not get created from the db refresh)
                Once completed, user can look the content of the file <SVC_HOME>/bin/upgradeDB.log to ensure that the process completed without error.


8. Start Task Manager
	1. Ensure that all older cache folders are deleted. (<SVC_HOME>/bin/cache)
	2. Start the task manager: sudo bash <SVC_HOME>/bin/taskManagerStart.sh
	3. The content of the file stdout.log can be inspected to validate that the task manager is started correctly.


9. Upgrade Unity DB
	
	1. Upgrade DB
		1. Extract "unity-centrica-installer_B348.zip"
		2. modify the db.properties file and ensure you have the correct database connection settings
		3. execute the script "upgrade_db.sh"
		4. Once that is complete execute the script "seed_upgrade_db.sh"
		5. Ensure that there are no errors.
	2. Run the script from Oracle SQL Client
		update tbllookup set description = '(£) United Kingdom - Pounds', value = '£' where name = 'CS_GBP';



10.	Unity Installation: 
	1. Backup trilliant.war and unityami.war.	
	2. Clean up tomcat's webapps folder 
		Navigate to the /opt/tomcat/webapps folder and clean up the trilliant and unitami folders. 
	3. Clean up the temp files and generated files
	4. Delete the work folder /opt/tomcat/work
	5. Navigate the to the /opt/tomcat/conf folder. There should be another folder in there called Catalina. Inside that you should see another folder called localhost (/opt/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost). Delete the two files in there -> trilliant.xml and unityami.xml
	6. Copy the two war files (unityami_UnitySuite 9.2.4 Release.war, trilliant_UnitySuite 9.2.4 Release.war) to the /opt/tomcat/webapps folder.
	7. Rename the war files as below
		mv "unityami_UnitySuite 9.2.4 Release.war" unityami.war
		mv "trilliant_UnitySuite 9.2.4 Release.war" trilliant.war
	8. Start up tomcat
		Navigate to the tomcat bin folder (/opt/tomcat/bin) and execute "./startup.sh"
	9. Have a look at the tomcat log to ensure that tomcat started without any issues.
		"tail -f /opt/tomcat/logs/catalina.out" 
	10. Once its started open a browser and launch unity.
